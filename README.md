//Tip for Fully functionalslash commands
    1-.The individual command files, containing their definitions and functionality.
    
    2-.The command handler, which dynamically reads the files and executes the commands.
    
    3-.The command deployment script, to register your slash commands with Discord so they appear in the interface.

These steps can be done in any order, but all are required before the commands are fully functional.///////////
